Color Mixer

The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot be made by mixing other colors.&nbsp;
Mixing two primary colors, results in a secondary color:

Mix red and blue, you get purple.
Mix red and yellow, you get orange.
Mix blue and yellow, you get green.

Write a python program that prompts for the entry of two primary colors to mix.
Anything other than “red,” “blue,” or “yellow,” must display an error message.

Input may be either

the words for each color OR
a number selection from a menu.&nbsp;

If word input, you must&nbsp;allow for upper or lower case to be input, check out python "lower()" function.

In either case, the program should display the name of the secondary color that results.

Refer to grading rubric for further program requirements.
